                Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease. Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1975 to 2016, the prevalence of overweight or obese children and adolescents aged 5â€“19 years increased more than four-fold from 4% to 18% globally.

                The map below illustrates the population percentage of individuals living with Obesity in selected countries across the globe. As we can see, a large proportion of countries outside of Africa have been dealing with the Obesity epidemic in some capacity. Across the globe at least 1 out 5 individuals can be medically considered as obese, hinting at a huge ongoing medical problem that is not being properly addressed.
